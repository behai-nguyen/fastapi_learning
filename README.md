``FastAPI`` provides [excellent tutorials](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/learn/) that thoroughly introduce the framework. Two sections on security, namely [Tutorial - User Guide Security](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/) and [Advanced User Guide Security](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/security/), have sparked further questions, which we are discussing in this post. Hopefully, this discussion will lead to a better understanding of how ``FastAPI`` security works.
